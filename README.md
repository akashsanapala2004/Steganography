# Hide your message with Python

* Steganography Tool in Python

This Python-based Steganography tool allows you to hide secret text messages in various media files such as images, text files, and audio files. You can encode and decode the hidden messages with ease using this tool.

## Features

- **Text Steganography:** Hide secret messages within text files using invisible characters.
- **Image Steganography:** Encode text messages into images by altering the least significant bits of the pixel data.
- **Audio Steganography:** Hide secret messages inside audio files, altering the least significant bits in audio frames.
- **Encoding and Decoding:** Easy-to-use functions for both encoding hidden messages and decoding the hidden data.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `opencv` (for image processing)
  - `numpy` (for data manipulation)
  - `wave` (for audio file manipulation)
  - `matplotlib` (for plotting images)
  - `pandas` (for handling text data)

## Requirements

Before running the program, ensure that you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib

```bash
python Steganography.py
